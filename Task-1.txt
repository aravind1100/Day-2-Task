Question : Write a blog on the Difference between document and window objects

Document and Window objects:

    * The window object represents an open window in a browser.When an HTML document
      is loaded into a web browser,it becomes a document object.

    * The document object is the root node of the HTML document in Document
      Object Model (DOM) tree.

    * Both Window and document keywords comes under the "object" data type and can be 
      accessed from the Browser engine .

    * The document object is a property of the window object.
      Example:
       1. The document object is accessed with window.document or document.
       2. document.URL displays the URL of the browser window.

    * The document and window object have several methods by which we can perform several actions.
      Example: 
       1. window.alert() displays an alert box with a message and an OK button
       2. document.open() opens a new browser window
